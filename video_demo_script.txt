
Hi my name is Prithvi. Im from Bangalore, India. 
For my final project I have made a cloud storage service for photos and videos called "Drop n Pic". 

With the welcome page you are given two options to sign in and for new users sign up. For this presentation we will be creating a new user. 


On sign in. You are greeted to your gallery. This one is empty at the moment. Lets upload. 

Add 10 files and 1 video. 

Here the gallery is organized now. 

Go to videos tab to play video 

Go to photos tab to download and delete. 

Thank you very much.
